Hi, I’m @xecrets

I’m the original developer of AxCrypt, a file encryption software for Windows. This has since evolved into a cross-platform software for various platforms,
but is now run and maintained by a different company. Here on github you'll find the third iteration, called Xecrets Ez and Xecrets Command Line
available at https://github.com/xecrets/xecrets-cli, fully compatible, but remade into something sleeker and slimmer for Windows, macOS and Linux
with both a desktop app (Ez) and a fully featured command line.
I am also still the custodian of the original version 1 source code, now named Xecrets File Encryption 1.7.x,
available at https://github.com/xecrets/xecrets-file .

I mostly work in C#/.NET and mostly with backend, although I've been known to do some things in JavaScript and React lately.

There are times when I leave the computer and ski the mountains of the world like an ordinary man.

Contact information and more information about my software including downloads of ready-to-run builds for Windows, macOS and Linux
are found at my website https://www.axantum.com/ .
