Hi, I’m @xecrets

I’m the original developer of AxCrypt, a file encryption software for Windows. Although I've left this behind, I am still the custodian of the original version 1 source code,
now named Xecrets File Encryption 1.7.x, available at https://github.com/xecrets/xecrets-file .

I mostly work in C#/.NET and mostly with backend, although I've been known to do some things in JavaScript and React lately.

There are times when I leave the computer and ski the mountains of the world like an ordinary man.

Contact information is found at my website https://www.axantum.com/ .
